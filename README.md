📚 Library Management System – SQL Data Analyst Project
📌 Project Overview

The Library Management System is a comprehensive SQL-based Data Analyst project designed to simulate real-world library operations and demonstrate strong database design, data analysis, and querying skills.
This project focuses on data modeling, staging tables, data cleaning, analytical SQL queries, and performance evaluation of libraries.

It is built to reflect industry-level data analyst workflows, from raw data ingestion to meaningful insights generation.

🎯 Objectives of the Project

Design a relational database for library operations

Convert raw data into staging tables

Analyze library performance using advanced SQL queries

Identify trends such as:

Overdue books

Library utilization

Reader engagement

Fund allocation efficiency

Provide actionable insights using SQL analytics

🧩 Key Features

Structured database schema with multiple related tables

Staging tables for raw data handling

Data cleaning and normalization

Advanced SQL concepts implementation:

Joins

Subqueries

CTEs

Window Functions

Aggregations

Performance-based ranking of libraries

Trend analysis (e.g., increasing overdue patterns)

🗂️ Database Design & Tables

The project includes six major staging and core tables, such as:

Library details

Book inventory

Readers information

Issue & return records

Overdue tracking

Fund allocation data

Each table is designed with proper keys and relationships to ensure data integrity and analytical accuracy.

🔍 Analytical Use Cases Covered

📈 Identify libraries with increasing overdue trends

🏆 Rank libraries based on:

Number of books

Active readers

Book issues

Funds received

📊 Analyze reader engagement patterns

💰 Evaluate fund utilization vs performance

📚 Track most borrowed books and categories

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Relational Database Design

Excel / CSV for raw data handling

Git & GitHub for version control

🧠 Skills Demonstrated

SQL Query Writing (Beginner → Advanced)

Database Normalization

Data Cleaning using SQL

Analytical Thinking

Problem Solving with Real-World Scenarios

Version Control (Git)
